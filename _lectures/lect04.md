# Code from lecture

# Topics

## Working with doubles
* Evaluating expressions with mixed numeric types
* Typecasting int to double 
* Formatted output with doubles: cout.setf()

## Practice with single for loops
* Summing a series: Write a program that takes a parameter n as a command line arguments and computes the following" 

```
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/n
```
where n is the number of terms in the series.

Sample run of the program is below:

```
$./sumSeries 2
Sum of the first 2 terms is: 1.500
```


## Nested Loops
* Nested loops
* ASCII Art with nested loops

## Functions and funtion mechanics

* What happens when we make a function call
* Variable scope and lifetime
* Local vs. global variables
* Drawing memory diagrams
* Stack!
* Passing parameters to programs/main()
* Example programs taking input from command-line
