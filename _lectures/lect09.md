# Topics

## Code from lecture


## C++ Memory model
* Barebones model of memory: value vs address
* Scope: local vs. global
* Layout of compiled C++ program in memory: text, global data , heap and stack
* 

## C++ arrays
* Intro to lab04
* C/C++ arrays are like lists in Python and Arrays in Java. We will discuss the differences between these.
* Declaring and initializing arrays in C++
* Tracing code involving arrays
* Array pitfalls: out of bound array access


## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by value
